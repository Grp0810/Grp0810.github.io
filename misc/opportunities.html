<h1>Technology Opportunities in Society​</h1>
<h4>Creative expansion​</h4>
<p>AI-generated work provides opportunities for new forms of artistic expression and creativity. It is not limited to the human mind, as it can utilise the internet as well as massive database of information available to access. Furthermore, its exponential growth far exceeds what was thought to be possible. Limiting the laws around this work can pave a way for a new generation of artists to emerge. A popular example is the viral song “Heart on my sleeve” written by an anonymous user known as “ghostwriter”. The song uses AI generated voice overs of Drake and The Weekend. It has recently been removed from streaming platforms, with UMG (Universal Music Group) considering the work to be a “breach of our agreements and a violation of the copyright law” (Brydon, 2023). However, this is only one case, with there being many more songs that us AI-generated voices of celebrities. ​</p>

<h4>Workplace Usage​</h4>
<p>AI-generative tools are already being implemented in schools and jobs. Tools like ChatGPT, which has gained major popularity over the past year, are being used to increase the speed and quality of work. As an article on Korn Ferry denotes, a survey revealed that upwards of “46% are already using ChatGPT to complete work tasks” with roughly 80% of professionals believing that it is a “legitimate, beneficial work tool” (Ferry, 2023). Furthermore, the utilisation of ChatGPT does not stop at writing emails and documents. Korn Ferry additionally highlights that “stock traders and assets managers are already using ChatGPT to analyse stock-market trends and company data in order to predict share-price performance more accurately”. It is important to note that this is only one, although popular, AI-generative tool, with there being many more tools available on the internet. ​</p>
<p>However, the scope of AI-generation software may not be limited to its workplace usage. Copyright laws can create economic opportunities for AI developers and companies involved in AI-generated art. By allowing them to hold exclusive rights to their creations, they can monetize their artworks, license them to others, and negotiate contracts or partnerships with various stakeholders. These can include galleries, museums, and other commercial platforms.​</p>
<h4>New business models​</h4>

<p>Whole new business models can be created through the copyrighting of AI-generated work. The licencing of AI-software or algorithms, and the selling of AI-generated work can provide new revenue streams for artists and developers. An aspect of this is the licencing of AI programmes or algorithms. Businesses that have developed AI systems with unique attributes might licence their technology to other companies. These licences give recipients the ability to create their own AI-generated material using the algorithms or AI software. As a result, businesses now have access to cutting-edge AI capabilities without having to spend money creating their own AI infrastructure from scratch.Additionally, the sale of AI-generated works may open up new business opportunities for designers and creators.</p>
<p>Artwork, music, and even literature produced by AI can be considered valuable intellectual property. AI-generated works can be protected by copyrights, giving creators and artists ownership and exclusive rights over the product. This makes it possible for them to sell or provide licences for their AI-generated works to people, companies, or other organisations. It creates a new market where AI-generated products can be purchased and sold, giving creators and artists previously unattainable financial prospects. (Dunlap, 2023) However, as AI-generated content becomes more common, it also raises important considerations around attribution, ethics, and legal frameworks. ensuring the ownership of AI-generated work and making fair compensation for all contributors involved, including both the human creators and the AI algorithms, is a complex area that requires careful attention.</p>
