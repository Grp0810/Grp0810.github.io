<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<h4>Frameworks and regulations</h4>
<p>Society must determine the adequacy of existing copyright laws in addressing the new challenges posed by AI-generated content. A balance needs to be struck between protecting the rights of original creators and fostering innovation of AI-generated works. Although the current laws may suffice, with the rapid growth of AI, changes need to be made to secure the future of both original artists and new generation artists. In the case of there being little to no restrictions for AI-generation of artistic content then, as we have seen and discussed, existing artist will face an immeasurable amount of competition and eventually their jobs will become obsolete. On the other hand, heavily regulating AI art generation will restrict new artists and new job opportunities. It will only slow down the inevitable.​</p>
<h4>Ethical Guidelines and Standards​</h4>

<p>Developing ethical guidelines and standards for AI generation is essential to ensure responsible and accountable practices. This includes transparency in disclosing the use of AI-generating software in content. People in the past have attempted to claim AI works as their own. Referring to what was stated at the beginning, AI work can only be claimed copyright if there is sufficient human intervention. It would be problematic if creators falsely claim AI work as their own, therefore it is essential that these guidelines are established.​<p>
