<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<h4>Frameworks and regulations</h4>
<p>Society must determine the adequacy of existing copyright laws in addressing the new challenges posed by AI-generated content. A balance needs to be struck between protecting the rights of original creators and fostering innovation of AI-generated works. Although the current laws may suffice, with the rapid growth of AI, changes need to be made to secure the future of both original artists and new generation artists. In the case of there being little to no restrictions for AI-generation of artistic content then, as we have seen and discussed, existing artist will face an immeasurable amount of competition and eventually their jobs will become obsolete. A report by Viola Zhou outlines how AI-generation tools like DALL-E-2 have troubled the Chinese video game art industry. A freelance illustrator by the name of Amber Yu has lost many of her possible job opportunities as gaming industries now have AI image generators integrated into their businesses (Zhou, 2023).</p>
<p>On the other hand, heavily regulating AI art generation will restrict new artists and new job opportunities. Although roughly 85 millions jobs are said to be replaced by the year 2025, a total of 97 million jobs, an additional 12 million, will be created by 2025 due to AI generative tools (Ascott, 2021). Among these newly created jobs due to generative artificial intelligence, a popular example is a prompt engineer (Griffith, 2023). A prompt engineers role is to "design and create prompts for large language models/LLMs". These prompts are fed to the LLMs and they, in response, generate a piece of creative content (text, art, music, etc.)Therefore, heavily regulating AI art generation may not be a favourable outcome as many future jobs will be lost. However, these statistics are only estimates and should be taken with a grain of salt.​</p>


<h4>Ethical Guidelines and Standards​</h4>
<p>Developing ethical guidelines and standards for AI generation is essential to ensure responsible and accountable practices. This includes transparency in disclosing the use of AI-generating software in content. People in the past have attempted to claim AI works as their own. Referring to what was stated at the beginning, AI work can only be claimed copyright if there is sufficient human intervention. It would be problematic if creators falsely claim AI work as their own, therefore it is essential that these guidelines are established.​ In some cases, people have tried to claim these works as their own without acknowledging the important contribution of AI algorithms. This raises ethical issues since it may distort the genuine nature of the creative process and interfere with the work of researchers and developers of artificial intelligence. Establishing rules that explicitly define the credit and ownership of AI-generated works is crucial to resolving this problem. In addition to addressing the problem of incorrect ownership claims, ethical standards for AI creation should take a wider range of factors into account. These might concern things like bias and fairness, data security, privacy protection, the ability to understand AI judgements, and potential societal effects. We can make sure that AI technologies are created and used in a way that respects human values, encourages ethical behaviour, and minimises harm by adopting thorough ethical principles (Glover,2023).<p>
<p>A key principle is that only when there has been sufficient human involvement or creative contribution into the creation of the work should copyright protection be provided. While AI systems are capable of producing material on their own. Therefore, copyright laws and guidelines should be updated to reflect the collaborative nature of AI-generated works, where the contribution of both humans and machines is acknowledged. By establising the criteria for copyright protection in AI-generated works, it becomes easier to identify between purely human created works and thoese that invovle AI assistance. This is important to ensure that credit is due to the human creators who helped shape and guide the AI systems.By clearly defining the criteria for copyright protection in AI-generated works, it becomes easier to differentiate between purely human-created works and those that involve AI assistance. This clarity is essential to ensure that credit is appropriately attributed to the human creators who actively shape and guide the AI systems.</p>
