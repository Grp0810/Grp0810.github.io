<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<h4>Protection of existing artist</h4>
<p>Many artists using the traditional method of production will face major issues with the rise of AI-generating software. Work that once took them hours to make can be generated in 10 seconds via a single prompt and the click of a button. What would be the point of paying someone to make you a logo or hiring a producer for a song to make an instrumental, when it can all be done for free and possibly better using AI. This will therefore result in major losses in revenue as original artist will see a massive drop in customers. Copyright laws need to be put in place to protect these artists and prevent this “new generation” of artist from exploiting the power of AI.</p>
<p>Recently however, a new tool has been designed to help protect artists’ work from being stolen and copied by AI art generators called Glaze (Burton, 2023). As outlined by Shannon,  this tool adds “minor, inconspicuous changes to an artwork” which cannot be detect by the humans, but its recognisable to AI software. This in turn causes the software to produce an image that differs from the intended style of the artist, therefore implying that the AI software can never learn  the artists' unique style and can never replicate it. If laws are not able to protect original creators adequately enough, then alternative methods like Glaze need to be utilised.​</p>
<h4>Copyright infringement and intellectual property​</h4>
<p>As we can infer from the previous paragraph, AI is exposed to large amounts of data and can unintentionally generate content that infringes upon existing copyrights. This raises questions on the reliability of these software; if we rely on this AI generating software to make artistic works for us, it may cause us to unintentionally end up in a copyright lawsuit. Furthermore, Stability AI (A company that uses Stable Diffusion deep learning method in training AI by gathering data across the internet) currently is facing a copyright lawsuit issued by Getty images. They “allegedly copying 12 million images to train its AI model without permission or compensation” (Vincent, 2023). There are a plethora of similar cases of AI generating software stealing content without reimbursing the original creators. This highlights the question of whether AI companies like Stability AI should pay for the usage of stock images in training of AI algorithms.​</p>
