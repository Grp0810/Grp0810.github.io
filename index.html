<h1>Copyright Laws of AI generated Artistic Works​</h1>
<p>The rapid advancements in AI technology have led to an increase in the production of AI-generated artistic works such as music, paintings and even literature. However, the question of copyright ownership for these works has become a contentious issue. Who owns the rights to an AI-generated work? Is it the developer of the AI algorithm, the user who input the data, or neither? As AI continues to evolve and produce more sophisticated works, it is essential to establish clear guidelines and regulations to protect the rights of creators and ensure fair use of AI-generated works.​

<p>In this assignment, we will explore the existing copyright laws concerning AI-generated artistic work and discuss whether these laws need to be reviewed in order to better fit to the technological changes in society.​</p>
<h4>Team Roles And Responsibilities</h4>
<h5>Blaine McDonald​</h5>
<p>My role in our team is to do research on the topic and type up relevant information into a draft. This draft will be shared with my team members so they can also learn some interesting information about the topic. Once my team members have copied the information to the team website, I will assist in the design process (although the lead role in the designing phase will be taken by Afsar). I will also be writing the references.​</p>

<h5>Afsar Nurul</h5>
<p>My role in this team is to review the draft and ask questions about the contents to learn about our topic more in depth. Once I have gained a good understanding, I will copy the completed and revised draft onto our team website. I will also design the website making sure it is presentable, easy to read, and easy to navigate. Finally, I will in charge of the final submissions of both our team website and PowerPoint slides that we create during our research.​</p>
